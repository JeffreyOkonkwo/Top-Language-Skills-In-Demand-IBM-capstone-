# Project Description

Being a Data/Business Analyst requires constant learning. The ability to always be in tune with the pulse of the industry is mandatory. Knowing how to use what is hot and trending keeps an analyst in demand. Thus, I have been tasked with obtaining data from various sources and identifying the trends for emerging skills needed in the world of analysis in 2021. The gathering of data begins with web scrapping reputable job/ training sites and surveys in order to streamline top reoccurring skills amongst top data analyst job postings. Once a sufficient amount of data has been collected, an in-depth analysis would be conducted to identify trends relating to:
